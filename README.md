# RoR2Sacrifice
Enemies now have a chance to drop items on kill (7% - this value cannot be changed), this scales with luck.

Enemy drop chances are designed to scale like the normal game, with extra rewards when an item drops from an elite or boss enemy.
Unlike EnemiesDropItems, Sacrifice allows barrels, chests, and select shrines to spawn. Have fun with that!

Additionally, having more players multiplies your drop chances 1.0 + .3 for every other player.

I did use EnemiesDropItems as the base for this mod, so be sure to give love to the original creator.

Install: Put the Sacrifice folder in your BepInEx plugins folder.
